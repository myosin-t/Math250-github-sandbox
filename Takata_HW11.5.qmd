## Problem1
```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
carseats <- ISLR2::Carseats
glimpse(carseats)
t.test(carseats$Price, mu = 110)
```

Null hypothesis: mu = 110($\mu = 110$)
Alternative hypothesis: mu is not 110($H_a: \mu \ne 110$)
The p-value measure the probability of getting an x-bar this far away from the null hypothesis $\mu$** The small values indicates evidence against the null hypothesis.
We conclude the mean price is not 110

## Problem2
Compute a level 90% confidence interval for the mean competitor price in the population from which this sample is drawn. What is the sample mean? What is the margin of error?

```{r}
mean(carseats$Price,
     na.rm = TRUE)
```
95 percent confidence interval:
113.4677 118.1223
sample mean:
115.795

margin of error = 115.795 - 113.4677 = 2.327
